    * need to clearly determine who can use the logs
        - currently set up for U server only
    * ringDaemon and ringClient are froprovisionally nt ends to the 
        same ringd.ringd.daemon.  When used as a client, it should 
        forward any log entries to the appropriate port on both ring 
        host 0 (presumably LA) and ring host 1 (presumably T)

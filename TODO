    * need to clearly determine who can use the logs
        - currently set up for U server only
    * ringDaemon and ringClient are froprovisionally nt ends to the same 
        ringd.ringd.daemon.  When used as a client, it should forward
        any log entries to the appropriate port on both ring host 0
        (presumably LA) and ring host 1 (presumably T)
